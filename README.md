Honeydew (["Honey, do!"](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/honey_do_list)) is a pluggable job queue + worker pool for Elixir.

```elixir
defmodule MyWorker do
  def do_a_thing do
    IO.puts "doing a thing!"
  end
end

:ok = Honeydew.start_queue(:my_queue)
:ok = Honeydew.start_workers(:my_queue, MyWorker)

:do_a_thing |> Honeydew.async(:my_queue)

# => "doing a thing!"
```

- Workers are permanent and hold immutable state (a database connection, for example).
- Workers are issued only one job at a time, a job is only ever removed from the queue when it succeeds.
- Queues can exist locally, on another node in the cluster, in your Ecto database, or on a remote queue server (rabbitmq, etc...).
- If a worker crashes while processing a job, the job is recovered and a "failure mode" (abandon, move, retry, etc) is executed.
- Jobs are enqueued using `async/3` and you can receive replies with `yield/2`, somewhat like [Task](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Task.html).
- Queues, workers, dispatch strategies and failure/success modes are all plugable with user modules.
- Can optionally heal your cluster after a disconnect or downed node.

Honeydew attempts to provide "at least once" job execution, it's possible that circumstances could conspire to execute a job, and prevent Honeydew from reporting that success back to the queue. I encourage you to write your jobs idempotently.

Honeydew isn't intended as a simple resource pool, the user's code isn't executed in the requesting process. Though you may use it as such, there are likely other alternatives that would fit your situation better, perhaps try [sbroker](https://github.com/fishcakez/sbroker).


### tl;dr
- Check out the [examples](https://github.com/koudelka/honeydew/tree/master/examples).
- Enqueue and receive responses with `async/3` and `yield/2`.
- Emit job progress with `progress/1`
- Queue/Worker status with `Honeydew.status/1`
- Suspend and resume with `Honeydew.suspend/1` and `Honeydew.resume/1`
- List jobs with `Honeydew.filter/2`
- Cancel jobs with `Honeydew.cancel/2`

### Ecto Poll Queue

The Ecto Poll Queue is an experimental queue designed to painlessly turn an already-existing Ecto schema into a queue, using your repo as the backing store. This eliminates the possiblity of your database and work queue becoming out of sync, as well as eliminating the need to run a separate queue node.

Check out the included [example project](https://github.com/koudelka/honeydew/tree/master/examples/ecto_poll_queue), and its README.

## Getting Started

In your mix.exs file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:honeydew, "~> 1.1.5"}]
end
```

You can run honeydew on a single node, or distributed over a cluster. Please see the README files included with the [examples](https://github.com/koudelka/honeydew/tree/master/examples).



### Suspend and Resume
You can suspend a queue (halt the distribution of new jobs to workers), by calling `Honeydew.suspend(:my_queue)`, then resume with `Honeydew.resume(:my_queue)`.

### Cancelling Jobs
To cancel a job that hasn't yet run, use `Honeydew.cancel/2`. If the job was successfully cancelled before execution, `:ok` will be returned. If the job wasn't present in the queue, `nil`. If the job is currently being executed, `{:error, :in_progress}`.

### Job Progress
Your jobs can emit their current status, i.e. "downloaded 10/50 items", using the `progress/1` function given to your job module by `use Honeydew.Progress`

Check out the [simple example](https://github.com/koudelka/honeydew/tree/master/examples/local/simple.exs).


### Queue Options
There are various options you can pass to `queue_spec/2` and `worker_spec/3`, see the [Honeydew](https://github.com/koudelka/honeydew/blob/master/lib/honeydew.ex) module.

### Failure Modes
When a worker crashes, a monitoring process runs the `handle_failure/3` function from the selected module on the queue's node. Honeydew ships with two failure modes, at present:

- `Honeydew.FailureMode.Abandon`: Simply forgets about the job.
- `Honeydew.FailureMode.Move`: Removes the job from the original queue, and places it on another.
- `Honeydew.FailureMode.Retry`: Re-attempts the job on its original queue a number of times, then calls another failure mode after the final failure.

See `Honeydew.queue_spec/2` to select a failure mode.

### Success Modes
When a job completes successfully, the monitoring process runs the `handle_success/2` function from the selected module on the queue's node. You'll likely want to use this callback for monitoring purposes. You can use a job's `:enqueued_at`, `:started_at` and `:completed_at` fields to calculate various time intervals.

See `Honeydew.queue_spec/2` to select a success mode.

## The Dungeon

### Job Lifecycle
In general, a job goes through the following stages:

```
- The requesting process calls `async/2`, which packages the task tuple/fn up into a "job" then sends
  it to a member of the queue group.

- The queue process will enqueue the job, then take one of the following actions:
  ‚îú‚îÄ If there is a worker available, the queue will dispatch the job immediately to the waiting
  |  worker via the selected dispatch strategy.
  ‚îî‚îÄ If there aren't any workers available, the job will remain in the queue until a worker announces
     that it's ready

- Upon dispatch, the queue "reserves" the job (marks it as in-progress), then spawns a local Monitor
  process to watch the worker. The monitor starts a timer after which the job will be returned to the queue.
  This is done to avoid blocking the queue waiting for confirmation from a worker that it has received the job.
  ‚îî‚îÄ When the worker receives the job, it informs the monitor associated with the job. The monitor
     then watches the worker in case the job crashes.
     ‚îú‚îÄ When the job succeeds:
     |  ‚îú‚îÄ If the job was enqueued with `reply: true`, the result is sent.
     |  ‚îú‚îÄ The worker sends an acknowledgement message to the monitor.
     |  |‚îÄ The monitor sends an acknowledgement to the queue to remove the job.
     |  |‚îÄ The monitor executes the selected success mode
     |  ‚îî‚îÄ The worker informs the queue that it's ready for a new job. The queue checks the worker in with the
     |     dispatcher.
     ‚îî‚îÄ If the worker crashes, the monitor executes the selected failure mode and terminates.
```


### Queues
Queues are the most critical location of state in Honeydew, a job will not be removed from the queue unless it has either been successfully executed, or been dealt with by the configured failure mode.

Honeydew includes a few basic queue modules:
 - A simple FIFO queue implemented with the `:queue` and `Map` modules, this is the default.
 - An Mnesia queue, configurable in all the ways mnesia is, for example:
   * Run with replication (with queues running on multiple nodes)
   * Persist jobs to disk (dets)
   * Follow various safety modes ("access contexts").
 - An Ecto-backed queue that automatically enqueues jobs when a new row is inserted.

If you want to implement your own queue, check out the included queues as a guide. Try to keep in mind where exactly your queue state lives, is your queue process(es) where jobs live, or is it a completely stateless connector for some external broker? Or a hybrid? I'm excited to see what you come up with, please open a PR! <3

### Dispatchers
Honeydew provides the following dispatchers:

- `Honeydew.Dispatcher.LRUNode` - Least Recently Used Node (sends jobs to the least recently used worker on the least recently used node, the default for global queues)
- `Honeydew.Dispatcher.LRU` - Least Recently Used Worker (FIFO, the default for local queues)
- `Honeydew.Dispatcher.MRU` - Most Recently Used Worker (LIFO)

You can also use your own dispatching strategy by passing it to `Honeydew.queue_spec/2`. Check out the [built-in dispatchers](https://github.com/koudelka/honeydew/tree/master/lib/honeydew/dispatcher) for reference.

### Worker State
Worker state is immutable, the only way to change it is to cause the worker to crash and let the supervisor restart it.

Your worker module's `init/1` function must return `{:ok, state}`. If anything else is returned or the function raises an error, the worker will die and restart after a given time interval (by default, five seconds).

### TODO:
- let the user decide if they want to `:ignore` during their init/1, to allow errors to bubble up the supervision tree.
- statistics?
- `yield_many/2` support?
- benchmark mnesia queue's dual filter implementations, discard one?
